# Genomical and mechanical characterization of bacteriophage genomes.
## Description
This repository contains the Python code scripts and figures associated with the study: "Molecular Characterization and Genome Mechanical Features of Two Newly Isolated Polyvalent Bacteriophages Infecting Pseudomonas syringae pv. garcae", https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/15/1/113
## Disclaimer
The materials available in this repository are for demonstration and disclosure reasons, so you can implement them and modify them for your purposes. The code implemented in this project is genome-dependent.
## Files guide 
1. DNA_shape_script: Script to handle DNA structural features of single genomes, such as Propeller twist, Helical Twist, Roll, etc.
2. Differential_dinucleotide_frequency: Script that finds dinucleotide frequencies in single genomes and plots a difference in their occurrence in a single dimension.
3. Dinucleotide_frequency: Simple script that finds dinucleotide frequencies.
4. Pairwise_correlation_plots: Simple Pairwise correlation of DNA shape.
5. Figures_related_to_code: Code-generated figures depicted in the article.
6. The pairwise distribution script as well as the cyclizability script are not available in this repository since the authorship does not belong to me, however, it can be requested via email to me!
