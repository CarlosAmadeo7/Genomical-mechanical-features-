# Genomical and mechanical characterization of bacteriophages's genomes.
## Description
This repository contains the Python code scripts and figures associated with the study: "Molecular Characterization and Genome Mechanical Features of Two Newly Isolated Polyvalent Bacteriophages Infecting Pseudomonas syringae pv. garcae", https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/15/1/113

the materials available in this repository are given due to demonstration and disclosure reasons. The code implemented in this project is heavily environment-dependent, and many supporting features that are crucial for a complete run are absent. In addition, some files, e.g., various databases, hmmsearch files, and of course the huge FASTA files, are excluded due to memory reasons.
